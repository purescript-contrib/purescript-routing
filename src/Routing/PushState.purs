-- | A `PushStateInterface` is a localized instance for making location changes
-- | and consuming the events. Since the DOM API does not provide a general
-- | event type for push state (only pop), you must use the coupled effects
-- | along with `listen` to receive events on all location changes.
-- |
-- | * `pushState` – pushes a new location state and path onto the history stack.
-- | * `replaceState` – replaces the location state and path in the history stack.
-- | * `locationState` – Dereferences the current history state
-- | * `listen` – Subscribes to location changes (both push and pop). Returns
-- |   an effect which removes the listener.
